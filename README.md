Code With Ninja is my attempt to teach basics and those coding techniques to people in short time which took me ages to learn.
At Code With Ninja, I provide a quick and to the point demo along with resources of anything and everything I teach. Source code and other resources are hosted on my GitHub. 
I provide source code(if any) in the description of every video.
Quality programming videos in Hindi :)
